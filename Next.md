1. For the example form, mutations need a subgroup (supports multiple) called "Genotyping Assay". It should have the fields: 

Type of Assay (radio):
PCR followed by gel electrophoresis             	
PCR followed by sequencing
Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)             		
Derived Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences (dCAPS)             	
Allele Specific Amplification (ASA)             	
Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP)             	
Allele Specific Amplification (ASA)             	
High-Resolution Melt Analysis (HRMA)      
Other (please specify
